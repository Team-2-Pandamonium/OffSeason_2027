CONTROL SCHEME:
Driver:
left stick - left side wheels
right stick - right side wheels
RB - turbo mode
LB - slow mode

Opperator:
Y - Level 3
X - Level 2
A - Level 1
B - go to 0
DPad_Up - elevator up ("fast")
DPad_Up_Right - elevator up ("slow")
DPad_Down - elevator down ("fast")
DPad_Down_Right - elevator down ("slow")
RT - intake
LT - outtake
Left Stick - manipulator long arm
Right Stick - manipulator short arm

TODO:
elastic documentation 
    - camera feed
    - elevator height
    - if it is at either endstop
    - drivemode
elevator trajectory planning instead of pid (LOW PRIORITY)
manipulator
    - Encoder value either drivebase motors,
    - both sides indivitually,
    - encoder value of intake,
    - using angular velocity, calc speed of robot on drivebase 
    - take speed and rpm of the intake, either raise or lower it using tangential speed, wheels going in would match speed of going forward
    - max speed correlated with speed of drivebase
    - if not moving, sets max speed of intake to a minumum value
    
    - take value of encoder vel value from drivebase each side, 1 motor
        - will get vel of motor, not vel of robot
    - make sure intake can't go below 10% (0.1)
